This project is a 3D interactive web application that is used as an orrery. The orrery is user controlled, and can be panned, rotated, and zoomed in or out. The user can toggle on and off three different types of objects shown: planets, comets, and dwarf planets. The user can control the speed of the orbiting objects to allow for better observation. The application also maps out the orbits, displaying their eccentricity, inclination, arguments of periapsis, aphelions, and perihelions. This is important since it can be used to educate people about our Solar System by providing a visualization. Overall, it meets the requirements of the challenge as a 3D web orrery.
